# **Week #2**

## Detailed Requirements Elaboration

In the second week, the team focused on refining the functional and technical requirements for implementing key components of the project. The main focus was on improving user interaction, integrating machine-learning models and data processing, and generating user stories for further market analysis.

### Interactive user interaction:
Developed requirements for a fully functional toolbar with all features, ensuring uninterrupted operation and seamless integration with the application’s frontend (Vlad).

Defined requirements for an interactive text caret to ensure smooth and intuitive interaction with the application. Parameters for caret behavior, including data input handling and visual feedback, were specified (Vlad).

Requirements for integrating the model with the projector and adapter into the application interface were clarified to ensure compatibility with the frontend and improve usability (Polina).

### Data processing and model support:
Requirements for loading and pre-processing of new datasets have been formulated, including data formats, volumes and cleaning methods. This will allow the project to scale to handle a variety of input data (Max).


Technical details for running models with projection support and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), including hyperparameter tuning and performance optimization are worked out (Vlad).

### Visualization and monitoring:
Requirements for visualization of model training loess functions are defined to provide transparency of the training process and simplify debugging. Graphs should be interactive and exportable for analysis (Vlad, Kira).

### Code migration and infrastructure:
Clarified requirements for migrating code from Colab to a Git repository, including folder structure, documentation, and ensuring reproducibility of experiments (Kira).

### User and market requirements:
Based on market analysis and user stories, work has started on defining the target audience and key usage scenarios of the application. This includes the visual style of the interface and user expectations from the functionality (Janna).

## Weekly commitments

### Individual contribution of each participant

- **Vlad**: Developed interactive text caret code, implemented a fully functional toolbar with uninterrupted operation, created model running code with projections and LoRAs, and generated training loss function visualizations.
- **Kira**: Generated training loss function visualizations and transferred Colab code to the Git repository.
- **Max**: Wrote code for loading and processing new datasets.
- **Polina**: Integrated the model with projector and adapter into the application.
- **Janna**: Compiled the report, provided design screenshots, wrote user stories, and conducted market research.

  All materials showing our progress are stored on disk. screenshots are sorted into folders for each team member.

## Plan for Next Week

*No information provided for the plan for next week.*
# ТУТ ДОЛЖНЫ БЫТЬ ПЛАНЫ НА СЛЕД НЕДЕЛЮ

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:

 * Can be run (Not fully free of bugs yet).
 
 * Runs on the intended platform: macOS 15 via Xcode.

If you encounter any problems running the setup, feel free to contact us and get help. Or maybe we can provide a video with how the current state of the prototype is working.
