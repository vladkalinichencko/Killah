# **Week #2**

## Detailed Requirements Elaboration

In the second week, the team focused on refining the functional and technical requirements for implementing key components of the project. The main focus was on improving user interaction, integrating machine-learning models and data processing, and generating user stories for further market analysis.

### Interactive user interaction:
Developed requirements for a fully functional toolbar with all features, ensuring uninterrupted operation and seamless integration with the applicationâ€™s frontend (Vlad).

Defined requirements for an interactive text caret to ensure smooth and intuitive interaction with the application. Parameters for caret behavior, including data input handling and visual feedback, were specified (Vlad).

Requirements for integrating the model with the projector and adapter into the application interface were clarified to ensure compatibility with the frontend and improve usability (Polina).

### Data processing and model support:
Requirements for loading and pre-processing of new datasets have been formulated, including data formats, volumes and cleaning methods. This will allow the project to scale to handle a variety of input data (Max).


Technical details for running models with projection support and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), including hyperparameter tuning and performance optimization are worked out (Vlad).

### Visualization and monitoring:
Requirements for visualization of model training loess functions are defined to provide transparency of the training process and simplify debugging. Graphs should be interactive and exportable for analysis (Vlad, Kira).

### Code migration and infrastructure:
Clarified requirements for migrating code from Colab to a Git repository, including folder structure, documentation, and ensuring reproducibility of experiments (Kira).

### User and market requirements:
Based on market analysis and user stories, work has started on defining the target audience and key usage scenarios of the application. This includes the visual style of the interface and user expectations from the functionality (Janna).

## Plan for Next Week

*No information provided for the plan for next week.*

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:

- \[ \] In working condition.
- \[ \] Run via docker-compose (or another alternative described in the `README.md`).
