### Model Training Description
- **Data Used**:
  - **LibriSpeech, Common Voice, Open STT**: Audio datasets used for training the MLP projector to handle audio-to-text tasks. These datasets provide diverse speech samples for robust audio processing.
  - **Text Datasets**: Not explicitly mentioned for Week #3, but likely include user-provided text samples for style personalization (as per Week #1 scope).
- **Training Process**:
  - The MLP projector was trained using A100 GPUs (estimated 85-160 GPU-hours from Week #1).
  - **Improvements**:
    - **Normalization**: Applied proper loss normalization by dividing by gradient accumulation steps, with weight updates only after accumulation.
    - **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Used OneCycleLR for stable training.
    - **Activation Functions**: Incorporated Z-normalization and GELU for improved audio understanding.
    - **Model Architecture**: Increased projector parameters for better performance.
  - **Validation Enhancements**:
    - Added debug prints for 3-5 examples with detailed diagnostics.
    - Conducted error analysis to detect empty, redundant, or insufficient generation.
    - Tracked detailed statistics (e.g., word length, error types).
  - **Console Output Overhaul**:
    - Implemented `print_vanishing()` for intermediate metrics, debug examples, validation results, checkpoints, and graphs to keep the console clean.
    - Ensured the progress bar remains stable and readable, with only critical validation results and events persisting.
  - **Metrics Logging**:
    - Automatically logged all metrics to Weights & Biases (W&B) for real-time monitoring.
    - Targeted significant Word Error Rate (WER) reduction from ~3.0 to 0.2-0.5 (20-50% improvement).
    - Aimed for improved BLEU and ROUGE scores due to enhanced architecture.
  - LoRA fine-tuning was applied to the Gemma 3 4B base model using the Hugging Face Trainer API and Accelerate for efficient training.
- **Model Decision Parameters**:
  - The model uses a 3-layer LoRA architecture (r=64) to adapt the base Gemma 3 4B model for style preservation and audio processing.
  - PersonaPlugs runtime conditioning ensures personalized text generation based on user writing samples.
  - Audio processing relies on a Conformer-based encoder integrated with Apple AudioKit, with the MLP projector handling audio-to-text tasks.
- **Next Steps if WER Remains High**:
  - Fine-tune Gemma with LoRA by unfreezing specific layers.
  - Increase projector dimensionality (e.g., 4096 or 8192).
  - Add more layers (4-5) to the projector.
  - Introduce cross-attention mechanisms between audio and text.
